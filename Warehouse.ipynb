        "Warehouse Layout Optimization is a classic problem in logistics and supply chain management that aims to design the optimal layout for a warehouse. The goal is to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and minimize the time taken for inventory retrieval. This problem typically involves deciding the optimal placement of goods within the warehouse, considering factors such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "Product Demand: High-demand products should be placed closer to the shipping area.\n",
        "Space Utilization: Maximizing storage space while maintaining efficient movement of goods.\n",
        "Handling Cost: Reducing the handling cost associated with product retrieval, restocking, and inventory management.\n",
        "Minimizing Travel Distance: Reducing the time taken for warehouse staff to move between storage locations.\n",
        "Approach to Solving Warehouse Layout Optimization\n",
        "Various approaches can be used for warehouse layout optimization, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "Heuristic Algorithms: These provide near-optimal solutions quickly. Examples include Genetic Algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), or Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).\n",
        "Exact Algorithms: These are typically computationally expensive but provide exact solutions, such as Integer Linear Programming (ILP).\n",
        "Machine Learning Models: Can predict product demand patterns and optimize the layout based on historical data.\n",
        "Genetic Algorithm Approach to Warehouse Layout Optimization\n",
        "In this approach, Genetic Algorithms (GA) can be used to evolve the warehouse layout by simulating a population of possible solutions over several generations. The fitness function evaluates the quality of the layout, and the best solutions are kept for further iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps in the Genetic Algorithm Approach for Warehouse Layout Optimization\n",
        "Initialization: Generate an initial population of random layouts. Each layout represents a potential solution where products are placed at different locations in the warehouse.\n",
        "Fitness Evaluation: Evaluate the quality of each layout based on criteria like product retrieval time, travel distance, and space utilization.\n",
        "Selection: Select the best layouts for reproduction. Layouts with lower retrieval times or better utilization are selected.\n",
        "Crossover: Combine parts of two parent layouts to generate offspring, i.e., swap sections of the warehouse layout between parents to create new layouts.\n",
        "Mutation: Introduce small changes to the layout, such as swapping two product locations, to avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n",
        "Termination: Repeat the process until a termination condition is met (e.g., a certain number of generations or a satisfactory fitness score).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation of the Code:\n",
        "Initialization: The population of potential solutions (warehouse layouts) is generated randomly. Each layout is represented as a list of product positions in a warehouse of fixed size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fitness Function: The fitness function computes the total travel distance between consecutive product positions in a warehouse layout. The goal is to minimize this distance, which indirectly reduces the retrieval time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Selection: Tournament selection is used, where a subset of layouts is randomly chosen, and the ones with better fitness (lower distance) are selected for reproduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Crossover: Two parents are selected, and their layouts are combined using a two-point crossover technique, creating two children that inherit parts of both parents' layouts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutation: A random swap mutation is applied with a certain probability (mutation_rate), where two product positions are swapped to explore new possibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Main Loop: The process repeats for a specified number of generations (num_generations). In each generation, the population evolves through selection, crossover, and mutation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Result: The best layout after all generations is printed, along with its fitness score (i.e., the minimized travel distance).\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "Genetic algorithms are powerful tools for solving warehouse layout optimization problems. By iterating over many generations, exploring different layout configurations, and applying natural selection principles (selection, crossover, mutation), the GA can evolve to find good solutions even for large and complex problems. This approach is flexible and can be adapted to more complex fitness functions and real-world warehouse constraints.\n"
